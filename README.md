Stryng - String generic methods
=================================

Stryng collects all methods available on the String's prototype and String object itself, extends that set and populates it on another single global object `Stryng`.

Inverted signatures are not really intuitive but shine when it comes to
functional programming.

Error Reports
-------------

None of the functions fail silently if invalidly used. Most error messages
will report the function name and arguments of the invocation. See the docs for
the signatures of the added functions and browse the web on how to use the natives.
